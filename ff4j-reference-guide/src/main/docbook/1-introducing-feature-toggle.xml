			 The principe of <emphasis role="italic">Feature Toggle</emphasis> is to enable or disable feature through configuration, eventually at runtime.
			 The condition statement to toggle can be a simple flag (boolean) but also a more elaborate test with a set of rules. 
			 It's also called  <emphasis role="italic">feature flipping</emphasis>, <emphasis role="italic">feature flags</emphasis>, 
			 or even <emphasis role="italic">feature bits</emphasis>. Toggle features at runtime is mandatory to change behaviour of the application without restarting. 
			 FF4J is an implementation of the principle for the Java Plateform. It stands as <emphasis role="italic">Feature Flipping for Java</emphasis>.
			 
			 <note>
			 <para>As ff4j provides a restFul WebAPI, any application could work and check features through HTTP. 
			 It's not limited to the Java platform

			  <para>Martin Fowler, an architect working at Thoughtworks, has written on his professional blog in 2010, a introduction to the concept.
			  The full article can be consulted <ulink url="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/FeatureToggle.html">here</ulink>. He is known in the
			  community as one father of the continuous integration. 
       		  </para>
       		  <para>He defines feature toggle as : 
       		  <emphasis role="italic"> The basic idea is to have a configuration file that defines a bunch of toggles for 
       		  various features you have pending. The running application then uses these toggles in order to decide whether or not to 
       		  show the new feature.

				   <title>Definition</title>
				   
				   <para>As suggested by its name, the purpose of the continuous delivery set of practices is to release 
				    softwares as often as required. The delivery process is obviously automatic and triggered on demand, eventually after each developper commit. It allows 
				    'non-event' releases : no more prepared or anticipated, but performed anytime needed. For instance, Amazon pushes code into production 
				    in average, every 11.6 seconds.

				   <title>Feature Branching vs Feature Toggle</title>
				   <para>To be able to develop several features in the same time yet be compliant with the 
				   short-time development cycle there are 2 possibilities.</para>
				    
				     <para><emphasis role="bold">Feature Branching </emphasis></para>
				     <para>The first solution is to create branches in the source control system for
                      each new feature. The release is performed from sources hosted on trunk : features under development are ignored and won't be part of the build. 
                      When a feature is 'ready', the related branch is merged to the trunk. This operation may become very complex. Indeed, if several releases have be 
                      made since the initial 'fork' of the current branch, source codes can be potentially very different. This leads to a large number of conflicts to 
                      deals with.

      			     <para><emphasis role="bold">Trunk-based developement</emphasis></para>
       				 <para>The second solution is, on the contrary, to keep on developing in the trunk. The direct consequence is that incomplete or non-working (yet compiling) 
       				 code will be embedded in a release and pushed into production. To avoid any incidents the relevant source code is wrapped in a always-false condition. 
       				 The value of the condition is defined through configuration. As soon as the code is ready, the condition is set to true to start executing.

				 <title>Zero Downtime deployment</title>
				    
				     <para><emphasis role="bold">Blue/Green Deployments</emphasis></para>
				  	 <para>BlueGreen deployment is a term to describe the old way to perform "hot deploy" in high availability architectures. The application is deployed on several nodes of a cluster. 
				  	  During deployment, each node is stopped, the new version of the product is released and the node is restarted. One common problem is a lack of consistency between nodes. Is the release
				  	  required to change the datamodel for instance, the hot deploy is no more possible. Feature Toggle can be an answer. All servers will be updated in ther same way but without enabling the
				  	  the modifications. When the environnement is ready all nodes of the cluster can activate the new feature as the same time.

				  	<para>The concept of canary release is to enable a feature for a subset of the users population. Thoses users may have a particular role ()like "beta-tester", or
				  	may be located in some place (like pilot), or like Amazon feature can be first propose to employees and then to customers. It's an excellent way to get feedback
				  	from users but also real metrics on production environment. The feature toggle system wrapped any feature definition which can be enabled at runtime through configuration
				  	console.</para>

				    <para><emphasis role="bold">DarkLaunch</emphasis></para>
				     <para>The concept of Dark launch is to enable features progressively. For instance, only a fixed rate of incoming requests will use the new version of the product.
				     The main advantage is to measure the impact of evolutions for a limited flow of requests and then anticipate any load, performance or capacity problems. As detailed later, ff4j provides a 
				     "PonderationStrategy"" to implement exactly this use case.

				<section id="1-3-1-3"><title>Thin Client deployment</title>
					<para>
					 This clever use case should be considered when the release process is painful or the application is installed on third party devices. It has been used by Facebook 
					 for their iOS application. To publish an application on the appstore the process is always the same. Developpers package and submit the new version to apple teams which
					 MANUALLY validate it. It can take up to 48H. Once the application is published, any single user must have to download the application - again - from Apple servers.
					</para>
					
					<para> 
					 The basic idea of <emphasis role="italic">Thin Client deployment</emphasis> is to never publish new versions of the application in stores, but, instead, at startup, check 
					 current installed application against a web service and download new content if required.
					</para>
					
					<para>Feature toggle should be part of the process. When the feature is ready, it's activated in the server. Target clients (not all if you do no want to) at startup
					of their applications will get the updates.</para>

				  <para>The graceful degradation is a capability of a system to disable non-core functionnalities to free ressources for more important ones. As an example, on heavy load of an e-commerce
				  website, you can priorize the requests of customers which already have something in their cart, they are more likely to buy something. When a request hit the landing page, and feature toggle
				  strategy evaluates that it's not an important one, the user could be redirect to a dedicated page telling him to try later.</para>
				  
				  <para>Another example is the set up of quota. Imagine you would like to create a chatroom with 20 people. Once the quota is reached, the new users will be put in waiting room.</para>
